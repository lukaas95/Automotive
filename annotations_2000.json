OUR 2007 HYUNDAI SONATA NEEDED POWER STEERING FLUID AND BRAKE FLUID ON A REGULAR BASIS.  MOST RECENTLY WE LOST BRAKES AND HAD THE CAR INSPECTED.  THE INSPECTION DETERMINED THAT THE POWER STEERING LINES, BRAKE LINES AND FUEL LINES ARE SEVERELY CORRODED AND ALL LEAKING.  THE BRAKE LINES HAD THE MOST SEVERE CORROSION BUT THE FUEL AND POWER STEERING HAD CORROSION DEEP ENOUGH TO CAUSE A LEAK.  THESE LEAKS ARE NOT IN THE VICINITY OF FITTINGS OR CONNECTIONS.  THE WORST LEAKS ARE IN THE VICINITY OF BRACKETS OR LINE RETAINERS.  THIS CAR HAS BEEN SOLD AND OPERATED IN THE NORTHEAST SNOW BELT BUT THE CORROSION IS WORSE THAN MOST VEHICLES THAT ARE MUCH OLDER WITH HIGHER MILEAGE.

I installed a small booster seat in the passenger side back seat for my 10 year-old son. He got in the seat and attached his seat belt, which he has done hundreds of times before in our own car.   About 1 hour into a 2-hour freeway trip, a notification went off on the dashboard, telling me that a seat belt in the back had come undone. My son tried frantically to reattach the buckle but was unable. I had to exit the freeway and park on the side of the road.  When I tried to reattach the buckle, I saw why there was a problem: He had inserted the buckle into the CENTER receptacle, not the passenger-side one. The receptacle didn't click, as it was probably designed not to do, but because the metal of the buckle has a slight angle to it, there was enough tension for it to temporarily hold. However even a minor accident could have been fatal because my son wasn't property strapped in.   There are several issues here. First, the dash indicator should have been designed to tell me that there was weight on the right rear seat but no buckle was attached to that receptacle.   Second, the center receptacle did not immediately reject the right-most buckle; instead, the bent angle of the buckle's metal temporarily held it in place and made my 10 year-old believe he was strapped in.   Finally, the receptacles themselves have no play from side-to-side. This, plus the angle of the buckle's metal, means that when a booster seat is installed, there is not enough room to fully attach the buckle into the receptacle without exerting a LOT of force to push the receptacle to the left.  I can't imagine the buckle can be attached at all with a larger child seat. The image I attached shows why this is; attaching a car seat requires exerting enough force to bend the metal holding the receptacle in order to attach the buckle. \"\r",{"entities":[[467,471,"B-FAILURE_LOC"],[472,476,"I-FAILURE_LOC"],[493,497,"B-FAILURE_TYPE"],[498,505,"I-FAILURE_TYPE"],[719,725,"B-FAILURE_TYPE"]]}],["Glass in front of the moon roof exploded outward.

For months the car could be sluggish when first leaving garage (like something wasn't catching) but I don't think that was related (although that problem has disappeared it seems.) I drove the car one day. Parked it. Got in it the next day and it was dead. Battery (3 yrs old) was at 50%. Starter was fine. Assumed it was starter button on dash. When car got to Honda, battery was dead. First garage found blown fuses, replaced, blew/melted. Did get it to start after many trials, but then brake lights wouldn't turn off. Then next morning dead again. That's when discovered harness.

I had yearly  front end alignments done . 2020 and 2021.  I do an air check every 30 days.  There are no mechanical problems with my 2019 Toyota Tacoma.  When these Toyo Open Range A31 Tires were new they started out at 11/32 tread in August 2019.  As previously noted all 4 tires wore rapidly and chunked, rubber loss in thread.  By October 2021at 19,500  all 4 Tires were at 5/32 closer to 4/32 and had Chunking Rubber loss in threads on all 4 tires.  These tires lasted 2 years and 19,500 miles and must now be replaced.  Toyota does not warranty the Toyo Tires and told me to deal with Toyo Tires directly.  Toyo Tire has been challenging to deal with and are only offering 25% off towards a purchase of 4 new Toyo Tires. This in Unacceptable. Its reasonable for a consumer to expect more than 19,500 miles or 2 years from tires.  The Big Picture and Major Concern is Safetey !!  These Toyo Open Range A31 Tires Wore Out and Chunked with Rubber Loss in Thread by the time they were 2 years old and by the time they reached 19,500 miles.   For safety reason I must replace these tires.  I respectfully request that NTSB investigate this serious safety  matter.\r",{"entities":[[261,266,"B-FAILURE_LOC"],[272,276,"B-FAILURE_TYPE"],[277,284,"I-FAILURE_TYPE"],[289,296,"B-FAILURE_TYPE"],[301,305,"B-FAILURE_TYPE"],[306,312,"I-FAILURE_TYPE"],[313,315,"I-FAILURE_TYPE"],[316,322,"I-FAILURE_TYPE"]]}],["Tesla model X is infamous for its acceleration shudder.  they have replaced the drive shafts twice already.    when you accelerate the wheel vibrates only between 15-35 mph.

The engine light came on and the car was also smoking some. We checked the oil in the vehicle and it was empty. We put a quart in the vehicle to take it to the dealership. We were told that yes, the vehicle in fact did not have any oil in it. I asked them well were did the oil go? Is there a leak or something? Oil just doesn't disappear like that. The mileage on the car at that time was 93,543. It wasn't even due for an oil change. I was told that this particular vehicle burns oil and every thousand miles & we will have to add a quart to it at that time. We are now monitoring that. I see that Hyundai has an open recall for this same knocking sound and burning oil on the 2019-2020 models. My 2014 is having the same problem and now I will have to take it back and forth to the dealership to make sure they monitor and hopefully eventually fix the problem for me. Again all they said at the moment was add a quart every thousand miles. In a month period (March) I have had to add 2.5 quarts to the vehicle. The vehicle now has a total of 94,916 miles on it.

This morning I needed to use the car so I removed one of the charger, and used it for 1/2 hour then parked in the garage. Fast forward to this evening I  proceeded to rehook up the charger to the car, parking in garage, the car was not used for 10 hours so it was as cold as my garage temp, 20 degrees F. After reconnecting all leads, red clamp to positive post, black clamp to negative post, I plugged the charger adapter into an extension cable (about 6 feet), and then felt the need to clean up some trash in the garage. This impromptu helped me avert the disaster. When I was done with the trash outside, I went back into the garage to find out my garage was filled with smoke. Running to my car, lifted it hood, the charge was on fires and flame shooting out. I quickly ripped the charger, threw it on ground and stamped it my foot to extinguish the fire. It was shooting flames and chars everywhere.  Had I not cleaned my trash, it would have burnt my car and garage down. I was shaken to my core. For now, I have unplugged the second unit.   This unit I believe is still being sold in Harbor Freight.

It was aggressive and fortunately I disconnected the driver assist ÔÇ£autopilotÔÇØ and immediately pressed on the accelerator (not an intuitive action) to avoid causing an accident. There was no reason for the car to behave this way.  Furthermore, Tesla updated the software recently on my vehicle.  I purchased the vehicle with radar, whereby it would use the radar as an input in coordination with other information for the adaptive cruise control and auto steer. (Collectively called the ÔÇ£autopilotÔÇØ by Tesla.  This recent software update took the radar out of the equation and made my car function differently (less robust) by now only using the cameras and not the radar. The cameras on my model year are not, to my understanding, of the same capability as the cameras that Tesla is using with their newest models. Despite the cameras being older, tesla modified the vehicle via over the air software update to only utilize the cameras, again, despite the car being designed to utilize the radar as an input to the semi autonomous driving.   I take great issue with Tesla retroactively reducing the capability of my semi autonomous driving and not providing a warning or a clear choice. The phantom braking I experienced was after this software update that removed the radar.   It's one thing if a driver needs to be prepared to brake, but quite another if the car brakes EXTREMELY aggressively and the driver has to rush to press the accelerator, all while startled.   I work as an airline pilot and this seeming total disregard for safety, removal of radar input that the car has on board already, and lack of transparency to the driver would never be accepted in aviation.

It took considerable effort to maintain control of the motorcycle as the front end felt as though it would ÔÇ£slide outÔÇØ to one side or the other.    After inspecting the front tire I observed a noticeable ÔÇ£bulbÔÇØ or ÔÇ£blisterÔÇØ on the tread cap approximately 10ÔÇØ long.  This blister was very hot in contrast to the remaining lukewarm tire.  After the tire cooled, I could press my thumb against the blister, now receding, and feel the tread cap had separated from the inner core of the tire by approximately 1/2ÔÇØ.    Because of the remote location where this tire failure occurred, I had no other choice but to ride the motorcycle 22 miles back to the last town I had passed, Wilets California, at 10-15 mph.  In Wilets I was able to locate a motel and performed a tire swap the next day.    This Avon tire failure occurred without warning.  This same tire in a different size is now the subject of a recall for basically the same thing I experienced.  I propose the aforementioned tire recall be expanded to include all Avon Cobra Chrome motorcycle tires regardless of size.

A quote from a NY Times interview, featuring the founder of the Soft Lights Organization, states that, \"\"Halogen lights put out 1,000 to 1,500 lumens, while high-intensity discharge lights and LEDs can measure 3,000 to 4,000 lumens.\"\" Given similar complaints and these findings, I know I'm not alone here. It's also strange how commonplace it's become, when back in the day, people would get tickets for excessively bright headlights. They make driving difficult, unsafe and impede everyone's ability, to drive like a professional. Well will this be fixed? If you need to implement regulations, please do it. It would be for the safety of all. Driving is a responsibility and the rules of the road should encourage a mostly distraction free experience. I'm sure that's why every parkway doesn't look like Times Square, for instance. Some people already have difficult commutes, having to commute daily to major cities and there's no need to make the experience even more insufferable. Everyone should be able to see clearly and remain calm and something as simple as someone else's headlights shouldn't be causing major issues or frustrations.

As a so called safety feature, an alarm should chime and show on the dashboard if the individual seat is not locked in the forward position prior to putting the vehicle in gear. The vehicle will NOT go into gear if the alarm is activated. HOWEVER, the safety issue is that the wiring is defective so that when the seat is actually locked in the proper position, the alarm still sounds, and the vehicle can NOT be put in gear or moved! This creates the safety hazard as the vehicle cannot be moved in an emergency or non-emergency situation. A cutoff switch like the one for the airbag use should be installed. We were fortunate and not in a bad location and were able to contact the warranty roadside service in Branson, MO., when the vehicle couldn't be moved, but it could have proved deadly should this have happened elsewhere. The roadside assistance mechanic was able to disconnect the harness as a temporary fix so that the vehicle was able to be put into gear and driven, however the dashboard warning still shows up. At present, we are waiting for a new part (\"\"harness\"\") to come in to the Dodge dealership in DeLand, FL for the repair. Since this is a fairly new system for the seats, I thought I should get it on record as a safety issue. Not being able to put a vehicle in gear and move it is definitely a safety issue!

Door lock actuators pose an obvious safety issue, both if the door remains unlocked when it is supposed to be locked, and when the door remains locked when it is supposed to be unlocked.     In the latter case, following an accident where a passenger is incapacitated and the door lock cannot be reached by hand (and there's no external key slot), the only way to unlock the door is via the electronic fob.

We bought the car brand-new in May 2018. The problem started happening approximately 2 years after buying the car. The car fails to restart when you lift the foot off the break and instead, stalls the car. My husband and I have had the car stall at red lights, at stop signs, and recently while we were in the left lane of a major highway in traffic. Just this past weekend, it stalled on me twice in less than 24 hours. It takes quite a bit of time to restart because you have to put the car in park and make sure it is completely shut down before trying to start it again, while also trying to remember to put on hazard lights.  I did bring it to Lia Honda in Albany NY on Sept. 24, 2021, 3.5 years after buying the car, specifically for this issue. They could not recreate it in the shop. They suggested I needed a new battery and proceeded to install a new batter at a cost of approximately $500 (it is my understanding batteries should be replaced every 5 years typically). This helped for about 6 months but now the car is stalling quite often again. While they have a button to disable this system, it defaults to \"\"on\"\" every time you power the car off/on, and it is easy to forget to turn it off. This is a major safety issue as the cars behind me don't realize I have stalled. I realize this is a known issue as other Pilot owners have filed similar complaints, and I hope Honda fixes this issue because we paid a lot of money for this car and will have teenagers driving it soon.

After the fifth or sixth incident, I pulled over and searched a pdf copy of my owners manual and found a way to turn off the CMBS with a button on the dash.  This worked to stop the braking incidents, but I had to do it over again every time I restarted the engine after stopping for gas, etc.   This scared me and was dangerous as this would happen while i was going 70 mph.  I think every instance occurred while I was passing a \"\"big rig\"\", but I was never in the same lane as the truck.  Sometimes it was on a very gentle curve, but other times we (truck and I) were both going straight down a straightaway.  I had done similar trips previously in February, June, and July without having this issue, but had it happen multiple times on my October trip as described above. \"\r",{"entities":[[26,30,"B-FAILURE_LOC"],[31,40,"I-FAILURE_LOC"],[41,48,"I-FAILURE_LOC"],[49,55,"I-FAILURE_LOC"],[56,63,"B-FAILURE_TYPE"],[68,74,"B-FAILURE_LOC"]]}],["Vehicle was recalled due to spontaneous battery fire risk.

I told the service center manager that it's a lifetime warranty according to the Hyundai Motor America and Kia Motors America Resolve Engine Litigation [https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2883] He said that Hyundai should approve it to replace the engine and I should contact them for approval.

There was no impact. The dealer (Balise Subaru-Warwick RI) called me a liar about an impact and gave me nothing but lip service about Subaru of America possibly performing a \"\"good will\"\" replacement. The crack is large enough to place a credit card into. Never before have I seen a crack that wide. Safety glass usually hairline cracks. A glass replacement company told me Subaru is using unreasonable thin glass to lighten the cars to make the MPG numbers. But at the risk of safety to drivers?? I think windshields are pretty important to not mess around with. Minimum thickness should be a standard.\"\r",{"entities":[[23,33,"B-FAILURE_LOC"],[34,42,"B-FAILURE_TYPE"],[43,52,"I-FAILURE_TYPE"]]}]]}

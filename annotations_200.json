Re: Assurant Warranty Claim Number: [XXX]  Dear Sir/Madam: I am writing to you in hopes of finding a swift and satisfactory resolution since my Audi dealership-issued extended warranty claim is not being honored despite repeated efforts to resolve the issue.  Incident: On Saturday, September 25, I was driving on Route 42 when a pebble hit my front windshield and made a small crack underneath the rearview mirror.  Action Taken:  We immediately reached out to report the issue, but being a weekend, received no response. We did not use the car again, but by the time someone responded to us on 9/28 - 3 days later! - the crack had spidered out from its original size.  Details:  When the crack appeared, we immediately called Audi Fort Washington (where I purchased my car) and left a voicemail for the service advisor and then called Audi Cherry Hill (closest dealer) and left a similar voicemail. Then we started to text on the Audi website but the response seemed to be a bot that did not lead us to a human contact. Meanwhile, while we have NOT used the car since the incident happened, the crack has spidered out on its own beyond the size of the initial crack! We continued to try calling Audi on Sunday 9/26 and on Monday 9/27 and still received no response! On 9/28 we finally heard from [XXX]f, who contacted the warranty company and reported back to us on 9/30, that it was denied because of the size of the crack. I explained how if this crack happened on a Tuesday and was immediately taken into the dealership it would have been covered, and it is not our fault that it happened on a weekend and no one responded when we immediately reached out - to several sources - several times! I spoke with Assurant directly today on 9/30; they forwarded the information to process the claim. The replacement of the windshield and car rental should be covered under the warranty.

The two problems I am having seem to have been programmed into the onboard computer to fail after a certain time or mileage.  I will address each problem individually starting with the most hazardous one first.  The onboard navigation system utilizes a SD card program that becomes outdated as time passes.  I have received numerous mailing from Ford notifying me that the original navigation system is outdated and that I should update to a current one at a cost to me of $149.00.  The original system works fine for me and I felt no need to upgrade until the system began getting interrupted by prompts to update (see FIGURE 1 below).  When the prompt appears the navigation system is no longer operational.  The most recent of these interruptions became a serious and hazardous situation.  I was driving on the interstate nearing an interchange to switch to a different highway.  I was relying on the navigation system to direct me to the correct exit and this is when the prompt appeared.  The navigation system was now useless and will only resume normal operation if the vehicle is shut off and restarted.  You donÔÇÖt do this at 70+ mph!  My only option was to use my phone which meant I had to program it and while driving this is dangerous.  I feel Ford was being irresponsible by programming the prompts into the onboard computer that disable the navigation system in return for the sale of an updated SD card.  Ford was profit motivated in this programmed failure.

I called the Honda dealership and they weren't alarmed by this or even interested in looking at the car. The told me to select the \"\"disable auto stop\"\" when starting the car so the engine won't idle. This is OK as a short-term solution but remembering this every time we start the car isn't a sufficient solution. On instances when I forgot, the car stalls out, and now occurs at least once a week. I'm now resorted to adding a post-it note to remind myself (and anyone else that uses me car) to turn the auto stop off. This isn't practical solution for a defective, default feature that Honda added to their cars. There needs to be a permanent override for this unnecessary feature that compromises safety, not only for the vehicle occupants but for those trying to avoid the stalled vehicle. \"\r",{"entities":[[128,131,"B-FAILURE_LOC"],[132,139,"B-FAILURE_TYPE"],[140,143,"I-FAILURE_TYPE"],[153,156,"B-FAILURE_TYPE"],[157,161,"I-FAILURE_TYPE"],[162,168,"I-FAILURE_TYPE"]]}]]}

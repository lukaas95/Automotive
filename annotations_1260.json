Video was taken of the incidents.    Hyundai Motor America \"\"Hyundai\"\" is recalling certain model 2011-2012 Sonata vehicles. The brake pedal stopper pad can deteriorate allowing the brake light switch plunger to remain extended when the brake pedal is released. Consequence:       If the brake light switch plunger does not retract as it should when the brake pedal is not being pressed, the brake lights may stay illuminated preventing accurate communication to rearward following vehicles that the vehicle is slowing or stopping. Additionally, if the brake switch plunger is not retracted, then the transmission can be shifted out of PARK without depressing the brake pedal. Either condition increases the risk of a crash. Remedy:       Hyundai will notify owners, and dealers will replace the brake pedal stopper pad with an improved part, free of charge. The recall began on January 6, 2016. Owners may contact Hyundai customer service at 1-855-671-3059. Hyundai's number for this recall is 136.\"\r",{"entities":[[206,211,"B-FAILURE_LOC"],[212,217,"I-FAILURE_LOC"],[218,225,"I-FAILURE_LOC"],[226,229,"I-FAILURE_LOC"],[234,245,"B-FAILURE_TYPE"]]}],["Ford death wobble, truck shakes very much after hitting a bump or pot hole It has happened many times in the course of two weeks.

Every time it snows and a sensor fails, I have to exit the thruway and find a place to pull over and restart the car. In instances where roads are wet, cars ahead spray road mud and block the sensors. This happens constantly in upstate NY. Every few miles when  the sensors is blocked the car will lose cruise control and most of the safety features. The only way to recover is pull off of the road to restart the car. It happened, several times on 50 mile drive. It's unnerving when it does. When weather conditions are poor, I want to get to my destination safely, without extra driving caused by exiting to restart and merging back on the thruway multiple times. Any other modern vehicle that I have driven will clear a sensor failure when the condition no longer exists, without restarting the car. The Mach-E refuses to clear sensors unless it's restarted.

This has caused a concerning increase in the theft of Kias across the country which has also affected my insurance rates. After repeatedly trying to contact Kia for two days on August 2nd and August 3rd, I was finally able to get in contact with customer service concerning the recent issue with Kias (model years of 2011 to 2021 with manual key start steering wheels) that are being stolen by just using a USB cord to turn on the car without a key. After waiting on hold for an hour, the customer service agent was extremely rude and uncaring about my concerns as my area is also being affected by these recent car thefts. My insurance rates have also gone up due to the overall riskiness of owning these cars and their likelihood of being stolen because it has a key start for the engine.   After doing research on the information available to me, I found out that Kia higher-ups approved measures to cut the costs by not including automobile immobilizers that have been the industry standard for a little over 20s years. It makes no sense that my older 2018 model Camry has industry standard parts but my 2021 Kia Forte does not. I am highly aggravated that I am stuck having to pay for a vehicle that has a higher likelihood of being stolen all because the company wanted to save a few dollars and not include immobilizers on their cars until the 2022 models. I am highly upset that Kia, their reps, and dealers have displayed an abhorrent lack of concern in trying to fix this issue as this prevents me from having to go to important job sites for work.

At noon on 10-24-21, I was testing the latest release of FSD as part of the beta program.   My Tesla was in self-driving mode on a city street at 35 mph. This was the same route it had already successfully done earlier in the day, when suddenly the car jumped over the curb, causing damage to the bumper, to the wheel and a flat tire. This appeared to have been caused by a discolored patch in the road that gave the FSD a false perception of an obstacle which it tried to avoid.  Immediately after the accident, the car was towed to the service center. The repair was finished on 10/27/21 at which time I was asked to pay $2,332.37 to take possession of the car. I explained that the damage was caused by the recalled version of FSD NHTSA recall number 21V-846 and that Tesla should be liable for the damages. I was advised that the engineering team would conduct an investigation and based on the results the money would be reimbursed.  However, I did not agree to pay hoping that after the investigation Tesla would honor the recall.  After two months of waiting, there is still no communication on the results of the investigation even though the case is quite simple. The car was going straight at a very low speed in self-driving mode. There is nothing except the recalled version of FSD that could have changed its trajectory. Therefore, it is obvious that nobody looked at this issue and there is no commitment to doing so anytime soon.

However, I feel there is an issue with the suspension manufacturing defects of Tesla model Y which did not activate or warned me to avoid a simple collision. There was also no automatic breaking which occurred to avoid the collision. Luckily, there were no injuries on my accident. In fact, what if the driver had severe injuries, unconsciousness or even fatal during the impact of accident ? What if I was on autopilot?

I was on a longer highway drive, and after about 70 miles I started to notice the steering problem. It became difficult to stay centered in my lane. When attempting to make very slight adjustments either left or right, steering input was met with resistance, almost like the wheel was stuck in a notch. As I pushed through the resistance, the wheel would suddenly snap free, resulting in an over-correction. This issue was constant for the rest of the drive, a little over 200 miles.  I was immediately concerned that this made the car unsafe, as the constant sudden steering corrections made it difficult to stay within my lane at highway speeds, especially in heavier traffic. The snap steering that resulted from pushing past the \"sticking\" point frequently caused the car to veer toward cars in the next lane, despite my effort to compensate for it.

The car did not display any warning messages or indicators. I ensured Lane Keeping Assist and Road Departure Mitigation were turned off, to verify that the problem was not related to any safety systems. But the problem persisted with those systems disabled.  The issue did not occur during the next few days of normal driving, but it returned a few days later on a longer drive, after about 45 miles of highway driving.   At first the problem mainly seemed to occur after prolonged highway driving, but in the last week both my wife and I have noticed the \"sticky\" steering more frequently in everyday driving, both at freeway speeds of 60mph and at lower speeds (30-40mph).  The car has not been inspected yet. I was wary of scheduling a dealer appointment due to the intermittent nature of the issue, though it's becoming more consistent.

Hairline cracks can develop within the transmission electronic gearbox (mechatronic unit), causing an internal transmission oil leak and a decrease in oil pressure.  Consequence: A decrease in transmission oil pressure can cause the clutch to fail to engage, resulting in a sudden loss of drive power, increasing the risk of a crash. Remedy: Volkswagen will notify owners, and dealers will update the transmission software, free of charge. The software remedy is currently under development. The recall is expected to begin February 4, 2020. Owners may contact Volkswagen customer service at 1-800-893-5298. Volkswagen's number for this recall is 34J6.

Sometimes it was one touch at a time (ie, change the radio station). Over time, and the more humid it was outside, I would have drives where every time the car was under 10mph, the touchscreen would go berserk. The car does have a feature where you cannot change settings when the car is going faster than 10mph, so thankfully this could not happen continuously. I had many instances where I would be braking to stop at a red light and the volume of the radio would go up so high that you would immediately cover your ears. (I keep radio at volume 10-15 and go to 30 when I want it really loud, it would go to 50 or more by itself). Obviously this is not good when you are at 10mph and still coming to a stop with a car in front of you.

Other instances involved the ghost touching turning off the \"\"brake assist\"\" option in the settings and turning off the \"\"rain sensing wipers\"\" feature all while driving. I would have to wait until my destination, then turn off the car and then turn back on to turn these safety features back on for the next drive.

It was previously used as a loaner car, and to my knowledge the car was in original condition with no prior bodywork done on the vehicle.

I explained to the service advisor, Gene Frank, that the car had never been in a collision since I owned it, and Gene stated that this is a common problem with Audi cars and if he filed a claim with the company, it would be rejected. Gene argued that my car may have been hit in the front by another car on the street, and when I asked why the front of the car doesn't show damage, he explained it was due to the plastic coating on the outside of the surface.  Based on the pictures taken by the service inspector and the reasoning for this damage, I argue that this damage was due to a faulty wire. The car is garage kept, has low mileage, has never been in a collision, and has never had body work performed on it. For all these reasons, I dispute the cause of this wire damage.

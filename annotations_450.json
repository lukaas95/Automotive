Since buying this jeep brand new, the vehicle information intermittently shows the axle lockers being engaged in 2wd high (2H).  I have brought it to the dealer twice for this problem.  First they reset the computer.  The second time they replaced the 4wd module.  The incorrect status is redisplayed again.  I have only had this jeep for 2 months, it has less than 3000 miles on it.  The dealer doesn't seem to know what the problem is.  I have talked with Jeep corporate who also says they can find no reports of this issue.  However the internet jeep forums are full of people reporting this problem, supposedly it is related to failed axle locker sensors on the Rubicon wranglers.  It is common enough an aftermarket company sells a wiring harness that bypasses the sensor.  Because the sensor is not available separately, eventually this requires the entire axle be replaced.  Some people have had their axles replaced 3-4 times.  There really should be a recall.  More than a few posters have also stated their axles have locked by themselves in 2H.

At other times it takes more rotations of the steering wheel to make the turn than it does to come out of the turn, 3) Constant adjustments to steering have to be made in order to stay in a lane regardless of whether the lane is straight or curved. It's like trying to maneuver a boat on water or like driving on a frictionless surface. It feels like the car switches to a different control system, either void of any driver control, or delayed response to driver input, and 4) The steering wheel has to be turned to almost a 90 degree angle before it engages the wheels while the car is running and stationary.  With the exception of item 4, the steering problems occur when there are other cars in the vicinity of our car. On secluded roads our car drives fine, so far. The steering issues occur during city and highway driving. The steering problems occur even when the following car assistive technologies are all set to off: automatic braking, hill assist, lane change assist, X-mode, Eyesight, and cruise control.  On May 4, 2021, we took the car to the Subaru Superstore of Chandler in Arizona. We showed the dealership a video of item 4 and they observed it. They described it as \"\"egregious\"\". The dealership stated that they could not find a reason for item 4 and they could not duplicate the other problems. They stated that they documented the problem.  Having an unresponsive/delayed response steering system could prove disastrous when seconds count to avert a disaster. This has been an ongoing problem since October 2018, with no resolution from Subaru.\"\r",{"entities":[[150,158,"B-FAILURE_LOC"],[159,164,"I-FAILURE_LOC"],[170,173,"B-FAILURE_TYPE"],[174,180,"I-FAILURE_TYPE"],[185,191,"B-FAILURE_LOC"]]}],["THE PAINT IS DEFECTIVE AND KEEPS PEELING OFF AND EASILY GETS DAMAGED FROM EVER JUST CAR WASHES.\r",{"entities":[[4,9,"B-FAILURE_LOC"],[13,22,"B-FAILURE_TYPE"],[33,40,"B-FAILURE_TYPE"],[41,44,"I-FAILURE_TYPE"]]}],null,["\"The Service Side Detection System (SSDS) maintenance light appears on my dashboard and remains unless I cancel it out by pressing the menu button on the turning signal.

On the Montana side of 4th of July pass I suddenly get a trouble code. The exhaust filter is full. My wife and I are both handicapped so in the mountains pulling our rv scared us both. I pulled over when I could and called Ford. The guy tells me to just drive it at a constant speed over 45 and it should clean itself. My question was I've been traveling over 45 for miles so why is it full? No explanation, however, he tells me if it doesn't clean out then the trk will go into limp mode and that's not good. But also says we should be ok for the 200 remaining miles until we get to Idaho. Well here's the problem. My understanding is that this component is part of the emission system and is not something that is life nor death if it isn't working. Well we get part way up the mountain not fifty miles in the middle of no where and the trk suddenly starts loosing power on a two lane mountain pass with two handicapped people, one 70 and one 62. This trk slows to 5 mph in first gear and that's itÔÇª. That as far as I'm concerned put our lives in danger! We could have died over a stupid part of the emissions system that Ford decided was important enough to put a vehicle into a not even a limp mode but actually create a dangerous situation. Why so they can charge me $200 to clean it. Which is done by hooking a code machine to the trk and telling it to clean the exhaust filter and it all automatic. I understand this limp mode and other computer controlled systems Ford and other manufacturers built into their vehicles allows them a way to get you into their shop but taking my wife and my life into their hands is not only dangerous but should not be allowed on such a level.
